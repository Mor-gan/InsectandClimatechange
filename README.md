     ** 0 = Pairwise **
     - Standard BLAST alignment in pairs of query sequence and database match.
     ** 1 = Query-anchored showing identities, **
     - The databases alignments are anchored (shown in relation to) to the query sequence. Identities are displayed as dashes, with mismatches displayed as single letter nucleotide abbreviations.
     **2 = Query-anchored no identities,**
     - The 'flat' display shows inserts as deletions on the query.
     **3 = Flat query-anchored showing identities,**
     - Identities are shown as single letter nucleotide abbreviations.
     **4 = Flat query-anchored no identities,**
     - The 'flat' display shows inserts as deletions on the query. Identities are displayed as dashes, with mismatches displayed as single letter nucleotide abbreviations.
